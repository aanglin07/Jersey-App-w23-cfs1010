# Jersey App 

York U React project CSFS-1010
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this App

This Application seeks to provide soccer fans with a one stop location to view old and new jerseys, while providing affiliate links to those jerseys to be purchased. Whether it's that jersey that brings back that nostalgic feeling of when your favourite team won that most coveted trophy or that most recently released kit, that fills fans with pride and hope of what a new season will bring. Users will be able to search and filter through a database jerseys and make purchases through affiiate links provided. They will also be able to create a wishlist jerseys that can be stored in a "wishcart" provided by the app. Users will be required to sign up and login to do so.
